  headline: An app which facilitates the creation and practice of interactive scenarios for extending theory knowledge into practice.
  summary: |
    With a brief from Dr Matthew Parry an app was developed which allowed admin users to create and manage scenarios which have a branching, non-linear, structure and where each answer could influence a range of custom measures. Examples include interviewing a client within a legal setting. Measuring factors such as compliance, client understanding and approach. Approaching a medical situation and measuring on proper procedure and situational understanding.
  overview: |
    A Tool to help user practice specific scenarios, such as interviewing a client, approaching a medical situation or
    facing something where they have performed poorly in the past.

    The key requirements were that it could have a **branching non-linear structureand that each answer could influence
    a range of variables.**

    During the initial research we spoke with another partner who was looking for a very similar tool to allow people to
    practice challenging scenarios where they had acted illegally in the past with the aim of helping facilitate their
    rehabilitation journey and prevent reoffending.

  headline: A web app to help prison leavers on their rehabilitation journey
  summary: |
    Working with Dr Gemma Morgan alongside the team members from Include and the service users they walk alongside, an application has been designed and built to help facilitate the work that Include do. The app comprises two sides of the same coin, one side for team members, the other for the service users. Team members have an overview of all the users and can delve into specific aspects of their journey. Users can use the application to record their wellbeing, to write a journal, keep track of their appointments, contacts and goals. All of these activities are encouraged using simple gamification.
  overview: |
    *By Gemma Morgan* At present criminal justice agencies both in the UK and internationally do not fully realise the
    opportunities that digital technologies offer to improve service delivery and the lives of service users. As a
    result, there has been little digital innovation within the realms of offender rehabilitation.

    The development and implementation of digital technologies in the area of offender rehabilitation are cutting edge.
    Currently, there is little to no innovation in this  area. As such, a range of technology can be developed to
    support organisations and their ervice users.

  headline: A web interface to a ML classification model for identifying conversations which contain grooming as part of the Detecting Resistance Against Grooming ONline (DRAGON) Project.
  summary: |
    As part of the DRAGON project led by Professor Nuria Lorenzo-Dus, we developed an interface that allows law enforcement officers to upload and process conversations which have been extracted from suspects devices. The model identifies grooming tactics in the conversations and gives an overall suspicion score to aid officers in the evidence gathering process. The interface allows conversations to be collated and viewed based on the participants, platform or suspicion score.
  overview: |
    Words by Principal investigator: Professor Nuria Lorenzo-Dus

    The Spotter tool will integrate Linguistics and AI to detect online grooming content, pinpointing the manipulative language tactics that groomers use: from making children feel emotionally isolated to communicating sexual intent implicitly and explicitly to them.

    The Spotter tool will aid law enforcement’s online grooming detection work.

    The Spotter tool will have a significant impact on our ability to keep children safe from online grooming, and successful tool development in English will furthermore pave the way for extension to other languages

  headline: A web scraping tool that collates the "Areas Of Expertise" for Swansea University academic staff across 3 colleges, the information is then provided in a searchable and filterable web interface.
  summary: |
    Using a Python script which runs daily using GitHub Actions, data is gathered from the public staff profiles on Swansea.ac.uk. This is then collated into a single file and hosted in a public interface. This interface allows exploration of the areas of expertise to match with users with similar areas of expertise. The entire app is based on the university website structure and reliant on staff providing their areas of expertise. If the web structure changes this app will break.
  overview: |
    A web application that collates the "Areas of Expertise" that live on individual staff member profiles into a single
    page and allows them to be filtered with a free text box and department dropdown.

    There are quite a few limitations to this work. As it is a web scraper it is dependent on the Swansea University
    website for its information, if the website structure changes it will stop working.

    At the moment it only covers the Hillary Rodham Clinton School of Law, the College of Science and the College of
    Arts and Humanities, the other colleges display their staff profiles in a different structure and so will need to be
    added in time.

    updated file is picked up by Netlify which hosts the website. The front end is a React web application that pulls

  headline: A web interface for displaying a collection of case law extracted from PDF documents into an ontology via natural language processing.
  summary: |
    The creation of the ontology via NLP extraction on the case law PDF documents was initially done by Livio Robaldo and our work built on this by taking the resultant XML and ontology model and producing the web interface as well as API endpoints. the information is presented in a responsive web design along with the ontological dependencies between them via the entities involved such as the judges, lawyers, courts and persons (though this latter entity was removed over GDPR concerns).
  overview: |
    This repository contains the application code for the Judiciary Akn Tagger (JAT). This application contains 101 case
    law files from https://www.judiciary.uk tagged in the Akoma Ntoso XML standard.
  tech-stack: |
    Composed of a Java back-end and React front-end, the data-sources for this application come from a combination of an
    Ontology Model, and the aforementioned XML files.

  summary: |
    A web interface and API endpoint to an NLP Java application developed by Livio Robaldo that can programmatically extract features from Key Investor Information Documents and return these features in a JSON structure. Built in collaboration with Zeidler group.
  overview: |
    In collaboration with the Zeidler Group. Words by Arne Zeidler:

    The problem that we want to address is the onboarding process of existing Key Investor Information Documents (KIIDs) from new clients to our application.

    At the moment, we have to copy and paste the content of each of the existing KIIDs into an excel based "standing data form", which is then uploaded to our application. This is an extremely time-consuming process, which can take months,and even with the greatest level of care, it is prone to human errors.

    The idea is to use AI to read the KIIDs in bulk and understand the sections so that our application can automatically populate the right areas of the database with the appropriate sections, including formatted text and numbersfrom the KIIDs.

    In summary, the idea is an automated onboarding process based on the "understanding" of the documents.
