  overview: |
    A web application that collates the "Areas of Expertise" that live on individual staff member profiles into a single
    page and allows them to be filtered with a free text box and department dropdown.

    There are quite a few limitations to this work. As it is a web scraper it is dependent on the Swansea University
    website for its information, if the website structure changes it will stop working.

    At the moment it only covers the Hillary Rodham Clinton School of Law, the College of Science and the College of
    Arts and Humanities, the other colleges display their staff profiles in a different structure and so will need to be
    added in time.

    A collection of web scraping python scripts are run daily by a GitHub Action, this generates a JSON file. The
    updated file is picked up by Netlify which hosts the website. The front end is a React web application that pulls
    the data out of the JSON into an HTML table.

  overview: |
    A Tool to help user practice specific scenarios, such as interviewing a client, approaching a medical situation or
    facing something where they have performed poorly in the past.

    The key requirements were that it could have a **branching non-linear structureand that each answer could influence
    a range of variables.**

    During the initial research we spoke with another partner who was looking for a very similar tool to allow people to
    practice challenging scenarios where they had acted illegally in the past with the aim of helping facilitate their
    rehabilitation journey and prevent reoffending.

  overview: |
    *By Gemma Morgan* At present criminal justice agencies both in the UK and internationally do not fully realise the
    opportunities that digital technologies offer to improve service delivery and the lives of service users. As a
    result, there has been little digital innovation within the realms of offender rehabilitation.

    The development and implementation of digital technologies in the area of offender rehabilitation are cutting edge.
    Currently, there is little to no innovation in this  area. As such, a range of technology can be developed to
    support organisations and their ervice users.

  overview: |
    [LawtechUK](https://technation.io/lawtechuk/") launched an interactive PDF to help "those innovating in law to
    navigate the regulatory landscape". You can read about it and see the [original PDF tool here](https://technation.io/news/launching-lawtech-regulatory-navigation-tool/)

    This original is a wealth of knowledge and an incredible tool, however we discovered it had several compatibility
    issues in a range of browsers.

    In a 1-day build, Ieuan took this tool and rebuilt it with ReactJS. After checking with LawtechUK its now live on
    the web.
