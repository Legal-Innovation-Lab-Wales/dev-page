  overview: |
    A web application that collates the "Areas of Expertise" that live on individual staff member profiles into a single
    page and allows them to be filtered with a free text box and department dropdown.

    There are quite a few limitations to this work. As it is a web scraper it is dependent on the Swansea University
    website for its information, if the website structure changes it will stop working.

    At the moment it only covers the Hillary Rodham Clinton School of Law, the College of Science and the College of
    Arts and Humanities, the other colleges display their staff profiles in a different structure and so will need to be
    added in time.

    A collection of web scraping python scripts are run daily by a GitHub Action, this generates a JSON file. The
    updated file is picked up by Netlify which hosts the website. The front end is a React web application that pulls
    the data out of the JSON into an HTML table.

  overview: |
    A Tool to help user practice specific scenarios, such as interviewing a client, approaching a medical situation or
    facing something where they have performed poorly in the past.

    The key requirements were that it could have a **branching non-linear structureand that each answer could influence
    a range of variables.**

    During the initial research we spoke with another partner who was looking for a very similar tool to allow people to
    practice challenging scenarios where they had acted illegally in the past with the aim of helping facilitate their
    rehabilitation journey and prevent reoffending.

  overview: |
    *By Gemma Morgan* At present criminal justice agencies both in the UK and internationally do not fully realise the
    opportunities that digital technologies offer to improve service delivery and the lives of service users. As a
    result, there has been little digital innovation within the realms of offender rehabilitation.

    The development and implementation of digital technologies in the area of offender rehabilitation are cutting edge.
    Currently, there is little to no innovation in this  area. As such, a range of technology can be developed to
    support organisations and their ervice users.

  overview: |
    [LawtechUK](https://technation.io/lawtechuk/") launched an interactive PDF to help "those innovating in law to
    navigate the regulatory landscape". You can read about it and see the [original PDF tool here](https://technation.io/news/launching-lawtech-regulatory-navigation-tool/)

    This original is a wealth of knowledge and an incredible tool, however we discovered it had several compatibility
    issues in a range of browsers.

    In a 1-day build, Ieuan took this tool and rebuilt it with ReactJS. After checking with LawtechUK its now live on
    the web.

    Words by Principal investigator: Professor Nuria Lorenzo-Dus

    The Spotter tool will integrate Linguistics and AI to detect online grooming content, pinpointing the manipulative language tactics that groomers use: from making children feel emotionally isolated to communicating sexual intent implicitly and explicitly to them.

    The Spotter tool will aid law enforcement’s online grooming detection work.

    The Spotter tool will have a significant impact on our ability to keep children safe from online grooming, and successful tool development in English will furthermore pave the way for extension to other languages

- name: KIID Onboarding Tool
  status: Development
  link: https://zeidler.group/insights/zeidler-group-announces-strategic-partnership-with-the-legal-innovation-lab-wales-to-build-ai-solutions-for-legal-delivery/
  open-source: false
  overview: |
    In collaboration with the Zeidler Group. Words by Arne Zeidler:

    The problem that we want to address is the onboarding process of existing Key Investor Information Documents (KIIDs) from new clients to our application.

    At the moment, we have to copy and paste the content of each of the existing KIIDs into an excel based "standing data form", which is then uploaded to our application. This is an extremely time-consuming process, which can take months,and even with the greatest level of care, it is prone to human errors.

    The idea is to use AI to read the KIIDs in bulk and understand the sections so that our application can automatically populate the right areas of the database with the appropriate sections, including formatted text and numbersfrom the KIIDs.

    In summary, the idea is an automated onboarding process based on the "understanding" of the documents.

    The Shield tool will relay specialist knowledge to child safeguarding professionals about groomers’ and children’s communicative behaviour during online grooming through a learning portal. It will also include a Linguistics/AI powered chatbot.

    The Shield tool will strengthen child safeguarding professionals’ ability to prevent children from being sexually groomed online. It will also allow end users to understand and better trust the AI decision-making process when identifying online grooming content.
