                Wales. We're a small team with big aspirations and we're trying to do things <em>right</em>. There are
                lot of different opinions when it comes to best-practices, these articles talk about our approach. You
                can also find them in our blog. </p>
            <p class="lead">There will be more coming soon.</p>
            <p>We'll soon be adding some additional articles here which discuss our approach to building
                software, including "Build Something Beautiful" and our take on "Getting Real"</p>
