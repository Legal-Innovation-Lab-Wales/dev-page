<h1>Template Title</h1>
<p class="subheading">A brief introduction paragraph summarising what the blog post is about. A one or two
    sentence tl;dr: to help the reader know whether or not its going to be a useful article to read. </p>
<p><em>Note: </em>This is a living guide. We follow these steps on a day-to-day basis. We will tweak and
    update this guide as we go along and learn form our mistakes</p>

<h2>h2 Start on Jira</h2>

<p>After a feature is outlined or described by stakeholders it will be added to the <em>Backlog</em>
    column on Jira. When creating the ticket, as much detail as possible should be given. We won’t
    always be able to provide a full user story, but give as much information as you can as early as you
    can. The backlog column is roughly prioritised with the more urgent tasks appearing towards the top.
</p>

<h3>h3 Teams</h3>

<p>We’ll try and post here fairly regularly. For now, we’re going to have an index on our developer page
    <i aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-code"></i> and we’ll post update on Twitter at the least. If you would
    like email updates then <a href="mailto:legalinnovation@swansea.ac.uk"> please let us know!
        <i aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-envelope"></i></a></p>

<h4>h4 Chats</h4>

<p>The main communication in teams happens in chats. <strong>These are informal conversations about a
    range of topics</strong> with specific people or groups of people. We have a Dev Team chat and a
    Legal Tech chat which are used most frequently.</p>

<h4>Channels</h4>

<p>Channels are a more structured way of having conversations around a specific topic. The nature of
    channels is more persistent and asynchronous. We should use channels for <strong>discussions around
        specific topics</strong> which aren’t necessarily related to a task in Jira.</p>


<h3>Planner</h3>

<p>We can check for system preferences using <code class="inline">window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme:
    dark)");</code> and we can get
    any previous site preference from local storage <code class="inline">localStorage.getItem("theme");</code>. So the
    first things we are
    going to do in our script is assign these to variables, and create a variable for our toggle button.</p>

<p>This is public within the Swansea.ac.uk domain so anyone can see what we are working on.</p>

<p>The cards link to further documents in OneDrive / Sharepoint which provide further detail on the
    project.</p>

<p>Planner doesn’t feel like the best tool for this but its the best we have at the moment - if anyone
    has any suggestions then please share!</p>

<h3>Jira</h3>

<p>Jira is our main software development project management tool. This is where the day-to-day of our
    dev team happens. We have several boards where individual cards correspond to individual tasks.
    These cards are often referred to interchangeably as tasks, issues or tickets.</p>

<p>The main Dev Team board is for general tasks which don’t relate to any specific project, or relate to
    projects which are not mature enough to warrant their own board. We also have separate boards for
    other ongoing projects, currently the Scenario Platform and the Include Journey.</p>

<p>On these project specific boards, each issue card should relate to one specific feature, bug or task.
    This normally equates to one Pull Request on GitHub.</p>

<p>Jira is also where we have <strong>discussions related to specific tasks.</strong> Comments can guide
    the conversation while the description can be updated collaboratively with improvements from the comments.
</p>

<h3>GitHub</h3>

<p>We use GitHub for version control, code repositories and peer reviews of our code.</p>

<h4>Code example</h4>
<pre><code class="language-js">function setTheme() {
    //if no local storage check against system preferences
    if (currentTheme === null) {
        if (prefersDarkScheme.matches) {
            currentTheme = "dark"
        } else if (prefersLightScheme.matches) {
            currentTheme = "light"
        } else {
            // if no preferences, default to dark theme
            currentTheme = "dark"
        }
        setTheme()
    } else if (currentTheme === "dark") {
        document.body.classList.remove("light-mode");
        document.body.classList.add("dark-mode");
    } else if (currentTheme === "light") {
        document.body.classList.remove("dark-mode");
        document.body.classList.add("light-mode");
    }
}</code></pre>
