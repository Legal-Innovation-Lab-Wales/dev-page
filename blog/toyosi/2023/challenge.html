<h1 id='technical-challenge'>Technical Challenge</h1>

<h2 id="contents">Contents</h2>


<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hiya, I’m Oluwatoyosi, one of the new Software Developer’s to join the Legal Innovation Lab. This blog describes my experience during the technical challenge of the role.</p>

<p>My project consists of two sub-applications. A frontend application and a backend application all managed within the same repository.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge of the challenge (winks) was coming up with the kind of project to build. Given a very limited time, I was torn on what exactly to build, how complex/simple it should be as I believed in order to land the role, I need to demonstrate my skill sets as much as possible but on a project that wouldn’t take too long to execute. </p>

<p>The project ultimately came to the core ‘web’ functionality of Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD). Having this in mind, I set out to build a simple Blog Application.</p>

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>

<p>The decision on what technologies to use in building largely came down to my experience. My work experience as a developer over the last 4 years was largely using Javascript, hence it is easier as I am more familiar with that language.</p>

<p>For the backend api, it was built using 
    <ul>
        <li>Node js</li>
        <li>Express js</li>
        <li>Sequelize ORM</li>
        <li>Swagger (for documentation)</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>The frontend of the project was built on React js. </p>

<p>The core features of the project are as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>User Authentication and Authorization</li>
        <li>View all blog posts</li>
        <li>View single blog post</li>
        <li>Edit and delete blog post</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Debrief</h2>
<p>
    After building the project, the next step was to walk the Dev panel through my thoughts and processes during development. This was quite easy to do as I explained the thought behind most of the decisions made during the process. The team was also very friendly and that brought about ease as I was a bit nervous prior. The panel was quite impressed with the project especially as it was properly documented (thanks swagger), I was asked to implement a quick and easy feature which I did, we discussed a few things which could have been improved and why certain things were handled the way they were. Finally, I was asked what feature could have been added if I had enough time
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall It was a very interesting project to work on once I figured out what I wanted to do. I did not spend too much time on coding as I completed the project with a day to spare, that gave me enough time to go through the whole coding logic once more before submission. As complex as a Blog could get, I decided to stick with the most basic functionalities it should have. </p>

<p>
    Since my resumption, I have been enjoying my experience on the team so far as everyone is nice and welcoming. It took a while joining the team due to some unfortunate delays but the whole team was quite patient and understanding of the situation.
</p>

<p>I would advise, if given a challenge just like this, choose a project which is not too complex but adequately demonstrates your skill as a developer.</p>
