<h1 id='technical-challenge'>Technical Challenge - Alaric</h1>

<h2 id="contents">Introduction</h2>
<br>
<p>
    When a Software Developer is looking to join a new team, it’s very important that they are able to demonstrate their skills 
    and prove they would be an asset if hired. It’s very common, therefore, that some kind of programming challenge is set to 
    quickly establish someone’s capabilities, as part of the interview process. 
</p>
<p>
    In my case, this challenge was to create any piece of software over a period of four days. I’m Alaric, and today I’m going 
    to tell you a little about how I approached this endeavour. 
</p>

<h2 id="the-idea">The Idea</h2>
<br>
<p>
    In this lab we primarily work with web applications, as they fit with our targets to satisfy stakeholders the best. However, 
    I come from a background in games development and previously had no experience in this space besides some basic understanding
     of HTML and design practices. I contacted the Lead Developer handling my challenge and asked if it would be appropriate to 
     build a small game, he was very happy to explain the brief was open-ended, and as long as I could demonstrate capacity, 
     understanding, and talent in programming and best practices then they would be eager for me to make whatever I liked. 
</p>
<p>
    With my confidence buoyed, I chose to stick with the technologies with which I’m most familiar: Unity and C#; effective 
    choices for quickly prototyping a game. Another important factor I had to consider is that I am a, truly, terrible graphic 
    artist. As such I needed to build something that could work with a very simple art style, to keep the time short and let me 
    focus on the all-important coding. 
</p>
<p>
    My concept was a simple 2D, puzzle-platformer, I called it: The Tech Lab. 
</p>
<p>
    You can find the finished project, as well as a standalone executable of the game (if you’d like to play it)

<h2 id="considerations">Design Considerations</h2>
<br>
<p>
    As well as demonstrating the requisite skills for the job interview, I also wanted to improve my understanding of various 
    aspects of game programming that I hadn’t tackled too deeply in previous projects. I always prefer to push myself to learn 
    and take on new challenges, rather than repeat the same things I’ve done before. Therefore I chose to include various 
    elements that I would develop more deeply than I normally do, such as: dialogue system, event manager, cinematic controller, 
    and a full auto-save/load system. 
</p>
<p>
    Working on systems and ideas I hadn’t done previously, along with the rest of the game, does present some important 
    difficulties, however. The technical challenge had a time limit, and it was very important there were no unfinished systems 
    that would detract from the overall polish of the project. To counteract this I made sure to follow SRP, DRY, and KISS 
    principles in order to keep a clear separation between the different systems. This meant that I had the option of dropping 
    some of these ideas from the project if time was running a little short, without compromising any other part of the game. 
    For example, the persistent save/load system had no impact on the game’s physics, and removing it would break nothing. 
</p>
<h2 id="building">Building The Game</h2>
<br>
<p>
    The basics of the game (movement, collision, camera movement) were very easy and quick to put together, as Unity has an 
    inbuilt physics system that is perfectly sufficient for this project’s needs.
</p>
<p>
    The event manager was the thing that I was most excited to implement at the start, however. 
</p>
<p>
    It’s very easy, in games programming, for there to be a lot of overlap in classes with direct referencing going back and 
    forth as elements need to communicate - this can make it difficult to maintain or extend. A solution to this is an event 
    manager, which can be used to allow disparate elements of a game to broadcast and receive messages from each other, without 
    ever directly interacting. 
</p>
<p>
    Mine functions by defining two ‘Dictionary’ objects that store events being listened for. Any object can add an event to 
    this list, or can broadcast a trigger that will activate these listeners. Using the 
    <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern#:~:text=In%20software%20engineering%2C%20the%20singleton,mathematical%20concept%20of%20a%20singleton.'>
        ‘singleton’
    </a>
    pattern, the event 
    manager’s static functions can be called by any class without setting up any prior references.

</div>
<p>
    <br>
    I used this system to allow for scripted events in a level, such as a character reacting to a door being opened; as well as 
    more integral gameplay aspects like resetting when the player character ‘died’. 
</p>
<p>
    With the basics of the game down, and systems set up to keep elements nicely compartmentalised; let’s look at a more unique 
    gameplay element I added: the ‘Entanglement Gun’. 
</p>
<p>
    I wanted to create a simple physics mechanic that would be quick to implement, given my time constraints, but also offer 
    enough possibility space in puzzle design such that it would suffice for my small prototype. The gun I came up with allows 
    a player to fire a projectile that would connect an object it hit with their character’s physics, so any force impacted on 
    the player would also affect this object. 
</p>
<p>
    One of the things this allowed a player to do is this: 
</p>

<p>
    <br>
    An ‘entangled’ character (red) can be manoeuvred over pits because the player (blue) isn’t falling, and any movement the 
    player makes, such as moving left and jumping, is translated. 
</p>
<p>
    The code to create this is actually quite simple (a basic mouse aim/fire function, and a bullet that uses the event manager 
    to activate an entagleable object on-hit), but I had to make sure it remained modular. Thankfully Unity has a particularly 
    useful feature for this: compound objects. Multiple scripts can be attached to a single ‘GameObject’, this allowed me to 
    design the system such that I only needed to add the ‘Entangleable’ script to an object to allow it to be manipulated by the 
    player.  
</p>

</div>
<p>
    <br>
    The most important takeaway from this system is that I ensured it was maintainable and extendable. When I presented 
    this project during the technical debrief part of my interview, I was asked to modify this mechanic so the player could 
    entangle multiple objects at the same time. Due to the logical way I structured my code, this was a very simple task of 
    changing only a couple of lines; specifically removing conditional statements that I put in to prevent the player from 
    firing the gun if it’s already entangled, or connecting to more than one object using a single bullet. 
</p>
<p>
    Of course I could delve deeper into the myriad of systems and elements that I put together to complete this small 
    prototype, but we would be veering too far into the territory of general game programming - which is a little out of 
    today’s scope. 
</p>
<p>
    I successfully completed the project with a little time to spare; although I do suspect I created significantly more 
    than is necessary for the challenge, it is still a valuable addition to my portfolio and a useful learning experience.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<br>
<p>
    The technical debrief was my opportunity to demonstrate my project to the dev team. I was able to play through my short 
    game while discussing the various systems I had implemented; I believe a functioning prototype with no bugs and reasonable 
    visual presentation is an excellent way to present my capacity to fulfil projects. 
</p>
<p>
    While we discussed what I had built, and how, I was asked several questions about how easily one might be able to modify 
    and add to the game. The lead developer took a general interest in my game, as well as my code, and ensured any task he 
    asked me to carry out as a demonstration would be reasonably easy and quick. Thanks to their excellent guidance, and my 
    thorough understanding of the code, I had a very positive and enjoyable debrief!
</p>
<p>
    In general I was very pleased at how I managed to properly organise and structure my code , and I believe it was key to my 
    success in the interview process. However if I were to do it again, I would likely choose a smaller, simpler project as 
    the criteria could have been met without committing to such a large undertaking for one weekend.
</p>
<p>
    When preparing for this job interview, I also began learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails as it is the lab’s preferred development 
    tool. As it is an object-oriented language, I mostly just needed to study the syntax using online documentation (the lack 
    of strict-typing was probably my biggest culture-shock), and there were various useful tutorials online to help me get set 
    up and experimenting with what can be put together quite quickly using Rails. Once I had brushed up on the MVC 
    web-development framework, I found RoR to be very powerful for quickly prototyping ideas without having to deal with a 
    lot of the basics it handles automatically. With only a week of learning, I feel I could have chosen to build a simple web 
    app using Ruby for the challenge and created something quite suitable. Although I went with using Unity and C# in the end, 
    having the knowledge of how I might translate my skills and work within this new area was very useful - and the interviewers 
    did find it a big plus that I had already started preparing to work with their most utilised language. 
</p>
<p>
    Overall I found the challenge to be quite a satisfying experience; from the start I was given good direction from the team, 
    and communicating my thoughts to them before the start time gave me confidence in building my project - allowing me to 
    stay focused throughout. The dev team encouraged me to ask any questions I had at any point, and were very happy to review 
    and chat about my somewhat unorthodox project during the debrief. 
</p>
<p>
    When it comes to completing a technical challenge like this, my advice is to stick to what you know you can do well 
    to demonstrate the requirements - if you’re ever in doubt you can simply ask, as the team is always happy to give advice 
    and clarifications. Even though the lab works primarily in Web Dev, I could show I had the required abilities even by 
    creating something as different as a game. 
</p>
<p>
    And I thought it would be fun!
