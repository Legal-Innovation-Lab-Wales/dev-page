<h2 class="text-center"><span class="link-spacer"></span>Tools We Use
    <button class="copyLink" onclick="copyText('#tooling')"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></button>
</h2>

<p class="lead">This aims to give an overview of the tools we use and the way we use them to build software in the Legal Innovation
    Lab Wales. It describes a current state, things are likely to change over time and we’ll try to keep this up to date
    as things evolve.</p>

<p class="lead"><strong>Update December 2021:</strong> We've updated the way we use a few of our tools and added a few more to our toolbelt. The
    original article is still available in our blog archive.</p>

<h3 id="tool-outlook">Office / Outlook</h3>

<p>The University has an Office 365 subscription for all staff. We use Outlook for emails and the Outlook calendar meetings/events.</p>

<h3 id="tool-teams">Teams</h3>

<p>As part of the office package we use Teams as our primary communication platform. We use it in a couple of different
    ways. The main "Team" is used to organise documents by the support team.</p>

<h5>Chats</h5>

<p>The main communication in teams happens in chats. <strong>These are informal conversations about a range of 
    topics</strong> with specific people or groups of people. We have a Dev Team chat and a Legal Tech chat which are 
    used most frequently.</p>

<h5>Channels</h5>

<p>Channels are a more structured way of having conversations around a specific topic. The nature of channels is more
    persistent and asynchronous. We should use channels for <strong>discussions around specific topics</strong> which 
    aren’t necessarily related to a task in Jira.</p>

<h3 id="tool-notion">Notion</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.notion.so">Notion</a> is our main knowledge base. We have a range of pages relating to specific
    projects as well as spaces for each of our developers to work on blogs and other writing. There are also pages for
    to help track the dev team's priorities and progress.</p>

<p>We also have an Ongoing Projects Board on Notion, which the wider team use to manage different projects, and their
    progress.</p>

<h3 id="tool-lucid">Lucid</h3>

<p>We use <a href="https://lucid.app/">LucidChart</a> as part of the project planning process. We create <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model">ERDs</a> and other technical drawings on
    Lucid. The ERDs serve as a reference for the database designs in our apps and will be kept up to date during development.</p>
<p>Lucid is also great for other diagrams and drawings. The project lifecycle document as well as some specific user
    flow documents have been created on Lucid.</p>

<h3 id="tool-figma">Figma</h3>

<p>We use <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> for designing user interfaces. We don't use this religiously, but
    when we need to showcase designs to stakeholders before we create them in code, Figma is the best tool for the job.</p>

<h3 id="tool-planner">Planner</h3>

<p>We no longer use Microsoft Planner</p>

<h3 id="tool-jira">Jira</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a> is our main software development project management tool.
    This is where the day-to-day of our dev team happens. We have several boards where individual cards correspond to
    individual tasks. These cards are often referred to interchangeably as tasks, issues or tickets.</p>

<p>The main Dev Team board is for general tasks which don’t relate to any specific project, or relate to
    projects which are not mature enough to warrant their own board. We also have separate boards for
    other ongoing projects.</p>

<p>On these project specific boards, each issue card should relate to one specific feature, bug or task.
    This normally equates to one Pull Request on <a href="#tool-github">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Jira is also where we have <strong>discussions related to specific tasks.</strong> Comments can guide
    the conversation while the description can be updated collaboratively with improvements from the
    comments.</p>

<h3 id="tool-github">GitHub</h3>

<p>We use <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> for version control, code repositories and peer reviews of our code.</p>

<p>For more information on how we use GitHub, Jira, and build features see
    <a href="#build-a-feature">“How to Build a Feature”</a></p>

<h3 id="tool-calamari">Calamari</h3>

<p>As with the rest of the faculty, we use <a href="#https://calamari.io/">Calamari</a> for time off booking and management.</p>

<h3 id="tool-zoom">Zoom</h3>

<p>As well as <a href="#tool-teams">Teams</a> video meetings, we often use <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> for video conferencing.</p>

<h3 id="tool-1password">1Password</h3>

<p>Most of our accounts require secure passwords and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">MFA</a>. I personally use<a
        href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> for password and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password">OTP</a> management. Although other <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">FOSS</a> alternatives are available such as <a
        href="https://www.lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>, <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a> and <a
        href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a>.</p>

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>

<p>The following tools are more specific to our software tech stack. We have a preference for Rails due to its
    developer-friendliness but do use Python and Java in some projects. We use the following tools as part or our
    infrastructure stack.</p>

<h3 id="tool-netlify">Netlify</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> is one of the tools we use for static site hosting. The Developer page is hosted here. If we need to spin up
    any other static sites, Netlify is something we would consider. Other than Netlify, we would consider using
    <a href="#tool-cloudflare">Cloudflare</a></p>

<h3 id="tool-cloudflare">Cloudflare</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/">Cloudflare</a> forms part of our technical stack. We use Cloudflare to
    manage the DNS for legaltech.wales domain and all subdomains. Cloudflare does all the things that they do really
    well; caching, firewalls, security and more. For most of our prototypes, Cloudflare sits between the user
    and <a href="#tool-heroku">Heroku</a>.</p>

<h3 id="tool-heroku">Heroku</h3>

<p>We leverage <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>'s PaaS to host the infrastructure our most of our prototypes, any full-stack apps are likely to
    live on Heroku.</p>

<h3 id="tool-rubyci">Ruby.ci</h3>

<p><a href="https://ruby.ci">Ruby.ci</a> does some automated checks on our code to help use maintain high quality.</p>

<h3 id="tool-sendgrid">Sendgrid</h3>

<p>As part of our prototypes, we use <a href="https://sendgrid.com/">Sendgrid</a> to power email sending from our Rails apps.</p>
