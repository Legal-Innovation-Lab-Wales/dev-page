</h2>
<p class="lead">We are a small team, doing big things. We need to be smart about our approach to software development,
    work hard but also work smart. Our approach to development is based off “Getting Real”, a methodology used by
    Basecamp.
    <a href="https://basecamp.com/gettingreal">Their full book is available online.</a></p>
<p>There are some core principles from Getting Real which we follow as we build software, these I’ll describe below,
    however our methodology is not identical to that in the book.</p>
<a onclick="collapseElement('#authorNote')">A note on the authors of Getting Real <i
        class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></a>
<p id="authorNote" class="hideable"> It’s unlikely that anyone is ever going to agree fully with someone else, and it is
    important to acknowledge and understand that. I only mention this due to some of the controversy which Basecamp was
    involved in recently.
    <a href="https://www.theverge.com/search?q=basecamp">(Search The Verge for “Basecamp” if you want to get up to
        speed)</a>. While, I personally don’t agree with the policy changes they implemented, I do strongly agree with a
    lot of the principles in Getting Real.</p>

<h4>Why do we take this approach?</h4>

<p>Most of our work is developing prototypes which can be used as proof of concepts to show a solution to a specific
    problem. These prototypes are simple and focused around solving a specific problem. We are not trying to build the
    next Facebook or Amazon. We are trying to engineer a novel solution which will be useful to the people that
    experience the need for it.</p>

<p>This need lends itself to this process, by directing our focus in this way we can build something quickly which can
    illustrate an idea without worrying about the details or dealing with potential problems before they need to be
    dealt with. This approach and modern software tooling, facilitates quick deployments and live updates. It makes it
    easy to iterate and lowers the cost of changes.</p>

<h4>Why don’t you just do “Agile”?</h4>

<p>With Agile, you normally work in continual 2-week sprints, led by a Scrum Master, or Agile Delivery Manager and often
    spend at least one day out of that fortnight on “ceremonies”. The features that are worked on are normally
    identified well in advance my a product manager, then designed by a designer before making it into sprint
    planning.</p>

<p>I’m aware that I’m mixing terminologies and that there is a vast depth here, but that’s the problem. We don’t need to
    go into all the complexity of Agile, Scrum, Kanban. We want to keep things simple, both in the code we write and the
    process we follow when writing it!</p>

<p>Agile was supposed to liberate software developers from process, but (at least from my experience, most of the time)
    its current form reduces developers to ticket machines. When you run a sprint, what's the first thing you do when
    you finish? You stop and catch your breath. Agile's perpetual two-week sprints don't allow for that pause, instead
    focusing on velocity of completing tasks, the factory line.</p>

<p>With a small team, each team member needs to wear many hats. Each of us needs to act as a designer, developer,
    product and project manager. We have pretty complete autonomy and responsibility for what we produce. We don't have
    the luxury of the additional roles which normally come to facilitate the Agile process.</p>

<h4>Quick Disclaimer</h4>

<p>To complement the <a href="https://basecamp.com/gettingreal/01.3-caveats-disclaimers-and-other-preemptive-strikes">“Caveats,
    disclaimers, and other pre-emptive”</a> strikes section in Getting Real:</p>

<p>This is not a post which is saying this is the best way to develop software, although I do think it's one of the best
    ways. We are not saying that this approach will work for you, although it might. This is just giving an explanation
    of the way which we have found works for us in the Legal Innovation Lab Wales.</p>

<p>This is also only our standard approach, we don’t follow this to the letter every time. Not every project we work on
    fits this mould. We’ll always prefer a flexible, adaptable approach which suits the project rather than trying to
    force a square peg into a round hole!</p>

<h4>What is our approach?</h4>

<p class="lead">The core principle is that we want to build something; something that works, something that looks and
    feels good.</p>

<h5>Planning</h5>

<p>As with any project, we start with planning. Working with the stakeholders, we'll outline their idea. Look at what
    problem it is trying to solve and how. We will help the stakeholders understand what’s possible, what would be
    unfeasible and suggest ways which we could engineer something enhance their idea.</p>

<p>We'll then look at the specific features which the solution needs, we'll normally categorise this using a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method">MoSCoW</a>.
    This determines the hierarchy of the requirements and informs which ones we need to focus on first. We can discuss
    with the stakeholders the technical difficulty of the features they would like. Often features are far easier, or
    far more challenging, than they might seem at first.</p>

<p>We don’t want to reinvent the wheel. We don’t want to build something which already exists. Before we build anything,
    we want find what existing solutions there are, look at what they do and what they don’t. What is good about that
    solution and what is not. What features should we share and what additional features do we need to create?</p>

<p>Planning is all about collaboration and conversation.</p>

<p>The outcome from the planning is an agreed upon set of core features which we think should be achievable in a 6-week
    development cycle. We work on the opinion that it's much better to build less features but to build them better.</p>

<h5>Development</h5>

<p>We’ll then spend 6 weeks engineering those features. When starting a project from scratch the first thing we'll do is
    create Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), this data structure informs the design of the back-end. Following that,
    we'll normally spin up a framework, most commonly <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>, but this
    will vary depending on the project.</p>

<p>With the basics in place, we can then split various area of the project up and work on them in parallel,
    collaborating and peer reviewing our code as we go. We’ll also check in periodically with the stakeholders to gain
    their input into the direction of what we’re building.</p>

<p>You can find out more about how we actually build features
    <a href="/blog/phil/2021/build-a-feature.html">in this article.</a></p>

<p>We want to build it well, so that it is extensible and maintainable. We are unlikely to be the ones who develop this
    software in the future, but we want to leave our code in a state that whoever comes along has an easy job, and we
    want
    to be proud of what we’ve built.</p>

<p>This means that we will rather take longer on each feature, ensuring its quality and reduce the overall scope of what
    we build than half-build lots of features.</p>

<p>This is where one of my favourite philosophies comes in. <strong>Build Something Beautiful.</strong> This refers to
    both the UI and the code that you're writing. It's much nicer to test a front end which is pleasant to look at. It's
    much easier to debug code which is clean, well formatted and, well, beautiful. In the early stages of development
    its important not to worry too much about the finer details, but I still believe its worth investing the time
    to get the interface looking like something your proud of. The same principles apply to the code you're writing.</p>
